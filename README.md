    Angular:
      Description:
        The frontend is developed using Angular, a powerful and dynamic JavaScript framework. Angular provides a modular and structured approach to building robust single-page applications.
        
    HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:
     Description:
       HTML and CSS are used for structuring and styling the application's user interface. Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, ensures a responsive and visually appealing design.
       
    TypeScript:
     Description:
       TypeScript is employed to bring static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer productivity. It adds an extra layer of reliability and maintainability to the frontend codebase.
